# Linear-Regression-of-Stock-Data-from-Scratch
Creating a linear regression model for Stock Market Data from scratch for an extremely low correlation for (Adj. Close vs Volumes) using just python lists and no other modules. 

Note: Numpy and Matplotlib are used but only for plotting and not for calculation/regression part.

Coming up with an alternate idea to increase correlation (Using a linear relation between Adj. Close price and Close price vs Volume)

Comparing with least square fitting method, finding cook's distance, and the outliers. 

Finding and removing the outliers and creating a new model. 

Plotting the points, the cook's distances and the final models, both of the linear relation vs volumes and adj. close prices vs volumes. 

Plotting both before and after finding outliers.
